Welcome to GitHub Time Tracker v1.0.2! This release introduces a powerful new calendar view, enhances time tracking with daily filtering, and updates our documentation to reflect the latest features. Designed to make your GitHub workflow even more productive, v1.0.2 brings intuitive tools to visualize and manage your time effortlessly.

## 🚀 What's New in v1.0.2

- **Current Day Accessibility**: The current day (e.g., May 14, 2025) is always active in the calendar, even without prior data.

- **Daily Filtering in Summary & History**: Summary and History views now show only today's data for focused tracking.
- **Updated Documentation**: `README.md` and `index.html` now highlight the calendar and outline future plans for refactoring and customization.

## 📋 Key Features
