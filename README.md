# GitHub Time Tracker

GitHub Time Tracker is a lightweight browser extension designed to seamlessly integrate time tracking into your GitHub workflow. It adds a simple and intuitive **Start/Stop Timer** button directly to every GitHub Issue page, making it easy to measure how much time you spend on each task — without leaving GitHub.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔘 Start/Stop Timer Button on Issue Pages
- Each GitHub Issue features a custom timer button.
- Start tracking time with a single click, and stop it with another.
- A live counter updates in real-time, showing exactly how long you've been working on a task.

### 📋 Popup with Time History & Search
- Access a detailed view of your tracked time history via the browser popup.
- View a log of all tracked issues, including total time spent, sorted by date.
- Search by task title or URL to quickly find specific records for reports or analysis.

### 🔁 Seamless Task Switching
- Automatically stops the timer for the previous issue when you start tracking a new one.
- Prevents time overlaps and ensures no progress is lost during task switches.

### 🔐 GitHub Token Integration for Commenting
- Optionally provide a GitHub Classic Personal Access Token to enable automatic commenting.
- Posts time spent directly to the corresponding GitHub issue, keeping your team informed and maintaining a transparent work record.

### 🧠 Smart Persistence
- Stores all data (time logs, current tracking state) locally using Chrome’s storage API.
- Persists across browser restarts; gracefully stops and saves tracking if the browser closes during an active session.
- Ensures no time is lost, even in unexpected scenarios.
